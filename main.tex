    \noindent I have rapidly improved at project management and problem solving in conjunction with problem-based project work at Aalborg University
    %                                        Communication Skills
    \begin{itemize}
        \myitem{} I have practiced various methods to lead problem oriented discussion, I have experienced the importance of daily or weekly status meetings for the structure of the project work. For this type of project management I have had both the leading role in the discussion and not, both giving valuable insight in the project.
        \myitem{} In my experience it is important to determine leadership in a project, and as such in multiple projects, roles of each member would be assigned to distribute responsibilities.
        \myitem{} I have improved a lot at sharing of knowledge, it's tricky to formulate advanced knowledge to a project group efficiently. Learning how important reflection is for a person to learn themselves was important for me. I believe that confidence is key to effectively share knowledge.
        \myitem{} My project work is often distributed between group members. I have experience using \highlight{git} and \highlight{Kanban boards} to manage the distribution of these tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    %                                        Project management tools
    \begin{itemize}
        \myitem{} I have throughout every semester at Aalborg University practised \highlight{problem analysis} as the first step of any project. As i have studied multiple places, i have also experienced writing a more technical analysis, going into details about the systems relevant for the problem.
        \myitem{} After a problem analysis I have experience writing a \highlight{Requirement analysis} and during my 7th semester project in conjunction with using the MoSCoW model.
        \myitem{} As a student i would like to focus my efforts on problem solving, and with an extensive background and personal interest in software, i think the most important skill as a developer is to have good practises in solving the problem. For me those include:\\
        -         Extensive testing knowledge, good documentation skills, and to keep code short and consise to improve readability and ease maintainability (i.e avoid new problems).
        \myitem{} Despite how irrelevant the project contract felt on early semesters, I have experienced situations where it has been neccessary to make use of the agreement in the contract.
    \end{itemize}
    %                                        Verifying problems
    \begin{itemize}
        \myitem{} In my opinion, a very important aspect in solving problems at Aalborg University has been to \highlight{verify} the correctness of our solutions to a problem. I have gained knowledge on extensive testing methods, important analysis points of a solution how to discuss these results.
                  I think this is important because you can't say the problem has been solved before you have been able to verify this, I learned the importance by doing the opposite on early semesters of my studies.
